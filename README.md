# (f)db

This is currently a prototype, with the idea of building incredibly fast transport layers on 
top of key-value (KV) databases. The goal is to allow one or multiple instances of these 
databases to be started and cross-shared in user space or accessed remotely bypassing general locks
that are enforced in KV databases or some of the OLAP databases such as DuckDB.

We're aiming to create a database wrappers so fast and efficient that it could be called the 
"f**k database" â€” a no-nonsense, high-performance solution for extreme speed and scalability suitable for HFS (High Frequency Trading) or basically
as a troll and actual description as this task is quite hard to achieve.

Though this will be hard to achieve without DPDK. Will not overkill the prototype with it for now...

**NOTE: At this moment I am adding all possible faster ways including TCP to be able do proper benchmarking first**

## QUIC (HTTP/3)

https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Buffer-Sizes

```
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=7500000
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=7500000
```

## IDEAS

- P2P Sync... (Supervisors vs. Readers a.k.a. validators vs clients)
- Could be grpc sync as well... Need to see complexity vs. benefits...
