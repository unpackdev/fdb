# Client TODOs

- [ ] There should be standard handlers that are loaded with each client and those are basically for general message passthrough...
- [ ] Each type of transport should have its own type like TCPTransport is...
- [ ] You should be able to quickly select the transport and send or read from the server.
- [ ] There should be a way to just do write-and-forget for 1Mil+ req/s
- [ ] Write client examples
- [ ] Implement this client approach directly into the benchmark instead of what we're doing now utilising go/net
- [ ] See what to do with QUIC as it's slow...
